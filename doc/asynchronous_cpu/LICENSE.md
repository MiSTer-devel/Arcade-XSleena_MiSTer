# LICENSE

I dislike having to record licenses at all.  My experiences have been that 99% of folks I deal with are honest and reasonable.  However, there is also a small subset who seem to be ethically absent.  I'm really only interested in being a hinderance to them and protecting myself from them.

I've been reminded that many people work for companies and organizations that have policies regarding use of source code from outside their domain, and that they typically have a set of predefined standard licenses that they'll accept.  My ideal is not the BSD license, but closer to a modified version.  

For those who wish to redistribute the source, or for those who require a well-known and standardized license, the stock BSD license is available.

For those willing to *not* redistribute the source and only wish to utilize the work - and don't care if the license is standardized or not, a modified license is available.  (The primary difference is that the modified version is binary-only, but does not require any citations.)

You must select one.

[Feel free to contact me if your needs fall outside of these.  Since I really just want to see the darned thing used, I'm likely to be fairly accomodating.]
